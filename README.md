# Active Directory Security Hardening Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates hands-on experience hardening a Windows Server Active Directory environment using Group Policy. The goal was to implement and document baseline security controls commonly used in enterprise environments.

## Environment
- Oracle VirtualBox  
- Windows Server  
- Active Directory Domain Services  

## Objectives
- Navigate Group Policy Management
- Review and configure domain-level password policies
- Apply security best practices to reduce account compromise risk
- Document security configurations with screenshots

## Security Controls Implemented
- Password complexity enforcement
- Minimum password length
- Password history enforcement
- Domain-level policy management using Group Policy

## Why This Matters
Weak password policies are a leading cause of account compromise. By enforcing domain-wide password standards through Group Policy, organizations reduce the risk of unauthorized access and credential-based attacks.

## Evidence
Screenshots included demonstrate:
- Group Policy Management console access
- Default Domain Policy configuration
- Password Policy settings applied at the domain level
